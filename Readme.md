# Alea Intelligence Website

This repository will contain the source code for the official Alea Intelligence website. The project aims to provide an informative and easy-to-navigate site that showcases our services and allows visitors to get in touch.

## Purpose

The website is intended as the public face of Alea Intelligence. It will present information about the company, our offerings, and any relevant updates.

## Prerequisites

- Git for cloning this repository.
- A modern web browser to view the site.
- Optional: Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm if you wish to run a local development server.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ProjetoGit
   ```
2. (Optional) Install any dependencies if a package.json is added in the future:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## How to Run or Preview the Site

- Once the site files (such as `index.html`) are available, you can open them directly in your browser to preview the site.
- To use a local development server, run one of the following commands from the project directory:
   ```bash
   npm start            # if a start script is defined
   npx http-server .    # or use a simple static server
   ```
  Alternatively, with Python installed:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
  After running a server, visit `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated in the output) to view the site.
